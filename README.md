Client's Instructions:
*****************************

I am working on creating a website for my non-profit foundation. I have already started the site on Godaddy. This is going to be a somewhat complex project with multiple drop down boxes and selections.

For example, my organization is going to cover Five states in the United States: California, Florida, Georgia, Colorado and New York.

So on the home page you will have to select your state. When you get to your state, there will be an introduction page where you select your county. On the County page, There will be profiles of the elected judges for that county where you click the hyperlink for more information.
